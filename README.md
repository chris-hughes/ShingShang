An ancient game modernised through node and socket.io

Things to do

  Change letters for symbols – check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode

·         Some of the game logic needs attention
				Make it so only dragons can land on target squares
				Check what is getting logged is correct (ShingShang biatch isn't logging)

·         Emit the move only when it is successful (ie. not when the other player is spazzing about)

·         Pair up the clients

·         Introduce nicknames and chat

·         Introduce basic AI (maybe use alphaBeta method https://github.com/davefowler/chess/)

 
For bonus points
 
·         Create a cool 3d version of Quoridor (see https://github.com/juliangarnier/3D-Hartwig-chess-set/blob/master/js/app.js)
